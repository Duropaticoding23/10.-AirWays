 Cows and Bulls Game

A simple number-guessing game implemented in Python.

Game Description:
The game generates a 4-digit secret number with no repeated digits. The player has to guess the number within a specified number of tries. After each guess, the game provides feedback in the form of "bulls" and "cows":

- Bulls: The number of digits that are present in the secret number and are in the correct position.
- Cows: The number of digits that are present in the secret number but are not in the correct position.

Code Features:

- Generates a 4-digit secret number with no repeated digits.
- Allows the player to specify the number of tries.
- Provides feedback in the form of "bulls" and "cows" after each guess.
- Checks for invalid guesses (numbers with repeated digits or not 4 digits long).

How to Play:

1. Run the script and enter the number of tries you want to have.
2. Guess a 4-digit number and enter it when prompted.
3. Based on the feedback provided, refine your guess and try again.
4. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the secret number or run out of tries.

Limitations:
1. Number Length: The game is currently designed to generate a 4-digit secret number. It does not support numbers of varying lengths.
2. No Repeated Digits: The game does not allow repeated digits in the secret number or the player's guesses.
3. No Negative Numbers: The game does not support negative numbers.
4. Limited Tries: The player has a limited number of tries to guess the secret number.
5. No Hint System: The game does not provide any hints to the player beyond the "bulls" and "cows" feedback.
6. No Multiplayer Support: The game is designed for single-player use only.
7. No Error Handling for Non-Integer Inputs: The game does not handle cases where the player enters a non-integer input.
